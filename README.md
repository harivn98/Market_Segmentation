# Market_Segmentation

Market segmentation using K-means clustering involves dividing a broad market into smaller, more homogeneous groups based on shared characteristics. The process starts with collecting relevant customer data, which is then cleaned and normalized. Key features are selected for clustering, and the optimal number of clusters (K) is determined using methods like the Elbow Method. The K-means algorithm is then applied, which involves assigning data points to the nearest centroids and updating these centroids iteratively until they stabilize. The resulting clusters are evaluated for quality and interpreted to understand distinct customer segments. Finally, businesses use these insights to tailor marketing strategies to each segment, ensuring more targeted and effective campaigns. Periodic reevaluation ensures the clusters remain relevant as customer behaviors change.
